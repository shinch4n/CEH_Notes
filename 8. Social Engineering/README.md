# **Social engineering is an act of stealing information from humans. Its a mind manipulation technique.**

- No interaction with target system or network
- Non-technical attack
- Convincing the target to reveal information
- One of the major vulnerability which leads to this type of attack is **Trust**.
- User trust in another user and does not secure their credentials from them.
- Employees are uneducated at organizations, so this is a major vulnerability.
- Lack of security policies and privacy are also vulnerable.

***Eavesdropping and Shoulder Surfing***
- Eavesdropping is a technique in which attacker is revealed information by listening to the conversation.

- Piggyback is a technique in which attacker waits for an authorized person to gain entry in a restricted area.
- Tailgating is a technique in which attacker gains access to the restricted area by following the authorized person.

## **Computer-based Social Engineering**

***Phishing***
- Attacker send fake emails which looks like legitimate email, they're sent to hundreds, sometimes thousands, of recipients. When recipient opens the link, he is enticed for providing information. Attacker use IDN Homographic Attack (International Domain Name), In this attacker use Crylic script to register domain name and create fake website similar to actual website.
		
***Spear Phishing*** --->
- Similar as phishing but it is focused on one target. Because of this, it is generate higher response rate.

**Mobile-based Social Engineering**

***Publishing Malicious Apps***
- These applications are normally a replica or similar copy of a popular application.

***Repackaging Legitimate Apps***

**Insider Attack**  --->
- Social Engineering is not all about a third person gathering information, it may be an insider with privileges.

- Popularly used for frauds
- Prove the fake identity to take advantage of it

# **Countermeasures**

**Secure sensitive data**
- Store Data at rest in a secure manner (Use Encryption or Salted Hashing). Don't share Sensitive info/Documents with everyone.
	
**Physical security**
- Who has access to Physical records (Data), who has access to sensitive areas (Server room, Admin block, Data Centres), and how you ensure that Physical security.
	
**Least privileges**
- Assign least Privileges to Employees/User.
	
**Strong policies**
- Password Policies, Access Policies, Device Controls, etc.
	
**Training**
- Train your Employees for popular and new S.E Attacks.
	
**Bio-metric authentication**
- Use Biometric authentication for Access and Entry Records.
	
**Audit**
- Regular Internal Audits and External Audits
