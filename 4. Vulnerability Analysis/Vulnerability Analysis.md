# **Vulnerability Assessment/Research**
```
Vulnerability Assessment is a process of examination, discovery, and identification of a system and applications security measures and weakness. It helps to recognize the vulnerabilities that could be exploited, need of additional security layers, and information that can be revealed using scanners.
```
--------------------------------
# **Vulnerability Assessment Life-Cycle**
- ```Discover``` : Discover Vulnerability
- ```Priotize``` : Priotize Vulnerability as per its target, impact, loss value, Bussiness Impact, etc.
- ```Report``` : Prepare a report on Vulnerability.
- ```Remediate``` : Take appropriate perventive actions.
- ```Verify``` : Verfiy that vulnerability is resolved or not.
- ```Monitor``` : Monitor the network traffic and system behaviors for any further intrusion.

# **Vulnerability Scoring System - CVSS (Critical Vulnerability Scoring System) -> CVE-CWE**
- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v2.0)
	- Low: 0.0 - 3.9
	- Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
	- High: 7.0 - 10.0

- Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3.0)
	- None: 0.0 - INFO   
	- Low: 0.1 - 3.9
	- Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
	- High: 7.0 - 8.9
	- Critical: 9.0 - 10.0

# **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) - Whenever a Vulnerability is exposed globally it is distinguished by it CVE number**
- Platforms to find information about vulnerabilities
	- https://nvd.nist.gov/

# **Vulnerability Scanners**
- Vulnerability Scanners are automated utilities to detect vulnerabilities. They are capable of :-
	- OS Detection and Version Detection
	- Applications Installed
	- Accounts with Weak Passwords
	- Missing Patches
	- Weak/Misconfigured Network and Risky Ports
- These scanning tools perform deep inspection of scripts, open ports, banners, running services, configuration errors, etc...

# **Top scanners**
- Nmap Scripts - Vuln, discovery, safe, etc
- Nikto
- wpscan
- Acunetix
- Nessus
- Qualys Free Scan
