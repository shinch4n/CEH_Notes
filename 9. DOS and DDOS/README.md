```
Denial-of-Service is type of attack on which service offered by a system or a network is denied/unavailable. 
Service may either be denied, reduce the functionality or prevent the access.
```

# **Symptoms of DoS attack:**
- Slow performance
- Increase in spam email --> SMTP
- Unavailability of a resource
- Loss of access to a website
- Disconnection of a wireless or wired internet connection
- Denial of access to any internet services

---

# **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**

- In DDoS, multiple compromised systems are involved to attack a target.
- The attacker send several connection request to the server with fake return address, so the server can't find a user to send the connection approval.
- The authentication process waits for a certain time to close the session.
- The attacker is continuously sending requests which causing a number of open connection on the server that lead to a denial of service.

# **Categories of DoS/DDoS Attacks**

**Volumetric Attacks**
- Denial of Service attack performed by sending a high amount of traffic towards the target.
- Volumetric attack are focused on overloading the bandwidth capability.

**Fragmentation Attacks**
- DoS attacks witch fragment the IP datagram into multiple smaller size packets.
- It requires to reassembly at the destination which requires resources of routers.

**TCP-State-Exhaustion Attacks**

- TCP-State-Exhaustion Attacks are focused on web servers, firewalls, load balancers and other infrastructure component to disrupt connections by exhausting their finite number of concurrent connections.
- Most common state-exhaustion attack is ping of death.

# **DoD/DDoS Attack Techniques**
	
**Bandwidth Attacks - DDoS**

- Bandwidth attack requires multiple sources to generate requests to overload the target.
- The goal is to consume the bandwidth completely.
- Zombie servers or Botnets used to perform this type of attack.

**Service Request Floods**
- Attacker flood the request towards a web service or server until it is overloaded.

**SYN Attack / Flooding**
- The attacker sending a lot of SYN request to tying up a system.
- The victim waits for the acknowledgement from the Attacker, but Attacker never send the acknowledgement.
- This waiting period ties up a connection "listen to queue", that can tie up for 75 seconds.

**ICMP Flood Attack - Ping of Death**
- Flooding ICMP request without waiting for the response overwhelm the resource of the network device.

**Permanent DoS Attack (PDoS)**
- Permanent DoS attack is focused on hardware sabotage, cause irreversible damage to the hardware.
- Affected hardware require replacement or reinstall the software.

**Distributed Reflection Denial of Service (DRDoS)**
- Attacker uses an intermediary victim which redirect the traffic to a secondary victim.
- Secondary victim redirects the traffic to the target.
- The intermediary and secondary victim is used for spoofing the attack.

**Botnet**
- Attacker compromises victims to make bot, which compromise other system to create a botnet.
- These botnets are controlled by **Command and Control server** owned by the attacker.
- This server is used to send instructions to perform the attack.

# **Tools**
	
- `Ping command`
- `Nmap DOS Script`
- `Hping3`
- `LOIC - Low Orbit Ion Cannon`
- `MSF Auxiliary`
- `Hulk` 
- `Github`

# **Preventive Measures**
	
- Use Load Balancers.
- Protect your network with Network Firewall. -- IDS / IPS
- Implement Web Application Firewall.
- Take Help from Cloud, they have more bandwidth than an enterprise would, which can help in large volumetric attacks.
